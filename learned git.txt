when you create a new repositary in local computer.

1. create a folder for your repositary and name it as the repositary name
2. go to github.com and create a new repositary and copy the url of the repositary
3. then open terminal inside the local repo folder. 
    a) command - git init
    b) command - git remote add origin <URL>
    c) command - git pull origin <branch name> // most of the times the branch name is main.
4. Now you can start working on the local repositary
5. when you do a significant change and needs to push to the remote then use the following commands.
    a) command - git status // looking at the current status of the local repositary
    b) command - git add . // adding all the files to the staging area
    c) command - git commit -m "<message describing the commit>"
    d) command - git push -u origin <branch name> // most of the times the branch name is main
6. Heres how you can work on local repositary updating the remote origin. 


Here are some another important information on git

Learn more about main and master on github and how to work with local repo using this stackoverflow thread
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64249491/difference-between-main-branch-and-master-branch-in-github

when you start working on local repo for first time you will start with master branch where you have to merge the pull requests from github.com when you push commits from local repo as master.
So you can change the branch to main using the following command
    command - git branch -m master main // this command does something similar to renaming the master to main
after executing the above command we can use the following command for push to the remote origin
    command - git push -u origin main


I got this following error 
"""
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Divisekara/tic-tac-toe-java.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
PS C:\Users\Asitha\Desktop\JAVA\tic-tac-toe-java> git push -f origin FixForBug
error: src refspec FixForBug does not match any
"""

this problem can be solved by forced pushing where the command is 
    command - git push -f origin main // f - flag stands for forced.

then we can keep pushing using the following code
    command - git push -u origin main
