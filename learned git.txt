3. then open terminal inside the local repo folder. 
    a) command - git init
    b) command - git remote add origin <URL>
    c) command - git pull origin <branch name> // most of the times the branch name is main.
4. Now you can start working on the local repositary
5. when you do a significant change and needs to push to the remote then use the following commands.
    a) command - git status // looking at the current status of the local repositary
    b) command - git add . // adding all the files to the staging area
    c) command - git commit -m "<message describing the commit>"
